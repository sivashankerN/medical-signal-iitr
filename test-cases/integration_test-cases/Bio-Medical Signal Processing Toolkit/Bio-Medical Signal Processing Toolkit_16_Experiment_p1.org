* Objective
  - To perform the Experiment of the Bio-Medical Signal Processing Toolkit experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/bio-medical-signal-and-image-processing-lab-iitr/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Bio-Medical Signal Processing Toolkit/Bio-Medical Signal Processing Toolkit_01_Usability_smk.org][Bio-Medical Signal Processing Toolkit_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Refer to step id 14
  2. Select the signal type from the drop down list present at the signal type field
  3. Set frequency,amplitude,phase,sampling frequency,simulation period and DC Bias using the scroll bar ao by manually entering the value at the corresponding fields
  4. Select the type of noise from the drop down list opresent at the noise type field
  5. Click on the import signal button
  6. Click on the  "Show Statistics" button
  7. Click on the theory button

* Expected result
  1. Refer to step id 14
  2. Based on the selected signal type,noise type and frequency values the amplitude vs time graph should be displayed on the screen
  3. The Aliasing radio button should get selected
  4. The selected signal should get imported and the pop-up window should get closed 
  5. The output should be displayed on the screen
  6. A new pop-up box should be displayed on the screen with the containing the theory in it

* Review/comments
